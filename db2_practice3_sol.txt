How many data blocks are allocated in the database for the table NIKOVITS.CIKK?
There can be empty blocks, but we count them too.
The same question: how many data blocks does the segment of the table have?

SELECT * FROM dba_segments WHERE owner='NIKOVITS'
AND segment_name='CIKK' AND segment_type='TABLE'; -- answer: Blocks column

---------------------------------------------------------
How many filled data blocks does the previous table have?
Filled means that the block is not empty (there is at least one row in it).
This question is not the same as the previous !!!
How many empty data blocks does the table have?

SELECT DISTINCT dbms_rowid.rowid_relative_fno(ROWID) file_id, 
 dbms_rowid.rowid_object(ROWID) data_object, dbms_rowid.rowid_block_number(ROWID) block_nr
FROM nikovits.cikk;
-- The number of these data blocks:
SELECT count(*) FROM
(SELECT DISTINCT dbms_rowid.rowid_relative_fno(ROWID) file_id, 
 dbms_rowid.rowid_object(ROWID) data_object, dbms_rowid.rowid_block_number(ROWID) block_nr
 FROM nikovits.cikk);

------------------------------------------------------------
How many rows are there in each block of the previous table?

SELECT dbms_rowid.rowid_relative_fno(ROWID) file_no,
       dbms_rowid.rowid_block_number(ROWID) block_no, count(*)
FROM nikovits.cikk
GROUP BY dbms_rowid.rowid_block_number(ROWID), dbms_rowid.rowid_relative_fno(ROWID);

------------------------------------------------------
There is a table NIKOVITS.ELADASOK@ullman which has the following row:
szla_szam = 100 (szla_szam is a column name)
In which datafile is the given row stored?
Within the datafile in which block? (block number) 
In which data object? (Give the name of the segment.)

SELECT dbms_rowid.rowid_relative_fno(ROWID) file_id, dbms_rowid.rowid_object(ROWID) data_object,
dbms_rowid.rowid_block_number(ROWID) block_nr, dbms_rowid.rowid_row_number(ROWID) row_nr 
FROM nikovits.eladasok WHERE szla_szam = 100;

SELECT * FROM dba_data_files WHERE file_id=2;
SELECT * FROM dba_objects WHERE data_object_id=127712;

-- We combine the previous two together:
SELECT dbms_rowid.rowid_relative_fno(e.ROWID) file_id, f.file_name 
FROM nikovits.eladasok e, dba_data_files f
WHERE szla_szam = 100 AND dbms_rowid.rowid_relative_fno(e.ROWID)=f.file_id;

Write a PL/SQL procedure which prints out the number of rows in each data block for the 
following table: NIKOVITS.TABLA_123. The output has 3 columns: file_id, block_id, num_of_rows.
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE num_of_rows IS 
...
Test:
-----
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
execute num_of_rows();

Hint:
Find the extents of the table. You can find the first block and the size in blocks.
Check the individual blocks how many rows they contain. (use rowid)

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE num_of_rows IS
 cnt NUMBER;
BEGIN 
 FOR rec IN (select file_id, block_id, blocks from dba_extents 
             where owner='NIKOVITS' and segment_name='TABLA_123' order by 1,2,3)
 LOOP
  FOR i in 1..rec.blocks LOOP
   SELECT count(*) into cnt FROM nikovits.tabla_123 
   WHERE dbms_rowid.rowid_relative_fno(ROWID) = rec.file_id
   AND dbms_rowid.rowid_block_number(ROWID) = rec.block_id+i-1;
   dbms_output.put_line(rec.file_id||'.'||to_char(rec.block_id+i-1)||'->'||cnt);
  END LOOP;
 END LOOP;
END;

Write a PL/SQL procedure which counts and prints the number of empty blocks of a table.
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE empty_blocks(p_owner VARCHAR2, p_table VARCHAR2) IS
...
Test:
-----
set serveroutput on
execute empty_blocks('nikovits', 'employees');

Hint: 
Count the total number of blocks (see the segment), the filled blocks (use rowid), 
the difference is the number of empty blocks.
You have to use dynamic SQL statement in the PL/SQL program, see pl_dynamicSQL.txt
