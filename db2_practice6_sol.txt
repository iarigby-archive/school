Oracle indices, Index Organized Tables, Partitions, Clusters
------------------------------------------------------------

Give the tables (table_name) which has a column indexed in descending order.
(In the solutions only objects of Nikovits are concerned.)

SELECT * FROM dba_ind_columns WHERE descend='DESC' AND index_owner='NIKOVITS';

See the name of the column. Why is it so strange? -> DBA_IND_EXPRESSIONS

SELECT * FROM dba_ind_columns WHERE index_name='EMP2' AND index_owner='NIKOVITS';
SELECT * FROM dba_ind_expressions WHERE index_name='EMP2' AND index_owner='NIKOVITS';

------------------------------------
Give the indexes (index name) which are composite and have at least 9 columns (expressions).

SELECT index_owner, index_name FROM dba_ind_columns 
GROUP BY index_owner, index_name HAVING count(*) >=9;

-- confirm one of them
SELECT * FROM dba_ind_columns WHERE index_owner='SYS' AND index_name='I_OBJ2';

------------------------------------------
Give the bitmap indexes on table NIKOVITS.CUSTOMERS. (Only in ULLMAN database)

SELECT * FROM dba_indexes 
WHERE table_owner='NIKOVITS' AND table_name='CUSTOMERS' AND index_type='BITMAP';

------------------------------------------
Give the indexes which has at least 2 columns and are function-based.

SELECT index_owner, index_name FROM dba_ind_columns 
GROUP BY index_owner, index_name HAVING count(*) >=2
 INTERSECT
SELECT index_owner, index_name FROM dba_ind_expressions;

-----------------------------------------
Give for one of the above indexes the expression for which the index was created.

 

-----------------------------------------
Give the index organized tables of user NIKOVITS.

SELECT owner, table_name, iot_name, iot_type FROM dba_tables WHERE owner='NIKOVITS' AND iot_type = 'IOT';

Find the table_name, index_name and overflow name (if exists) of the above tables.

SELECT table_name, index_name, index_type FROM dba_indexes 
WHERE table_owner='NIKOVITS' AND index_type LIKE '%IOT%TOP%';
SELECT owner, table_name, iot_name, iot_type FROM dba_tables 
WHERE owner='NIKOVITS' AND iot_type = 'IOT_OVERFLOW';

Which objects of the previous three has data_object_id in DBA_OBJECTS?

-------------------------------------------
Give the names and sizes (in bytes) of the partitions of table NIKOVITS.ELADASOK

SELECT * FROM dba_part_tables WHERE owner='NIKOVITS' AND table_name='ELADASOK';
SELECT * FROM dba_tab_partitions WHERE table_owner='NIKOVITS' AND table_name='ELADASOK';
SELECT segment_name, partition_name, segment_type, bytes FROM dba_segments 
WHERE owner='NIKOVITS' AND segment_name LIKE 'ELADASOK' AND segment_type LIKE 'TABLE%';

-------------------------------------------
Which is the biggest partitioned table (in bytes) in the database?
It can have subpartitions as well.

SELECT * FROM 
  (SELECT owner, segment_name, sum(bytes) 
   FROM dba_segments WHERE segment_type LIKE 'TABLE%PARTITION'
   GROUP BY owner, segment_name ORDER BY sum(bytes) DESC)
WHERE ROWNUM = 1;

------------------------------------------
Give a cluster whose cluster key consists of 3 columns.
It can have more tables on it!!!

SELECT owner, cluster_name FROM dba_clu_columns GROUP BY owner, cluster_name 
HAVING count(DISTINCT clu_column_name) = 3;
-- confirm one of them
SELECT * FROM dba_clu_columns WHERE owner='SYS' AND cluster_name like 'C_FILE%';

------------------------------------------
How many clusters we have in the database which uses NOT THE DEFAULT hash function?
(So the creator defined a hash expression.)

SELECT * FROM dba_cluster_hash_expressions;
