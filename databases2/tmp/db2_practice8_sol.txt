Exercise 17.1.1: 
Suppose that the consistency constraint on the database is 0 <= A <= B. 
Tell whether each of the following transactions preserves consistency.
a) A := A+B; B := A+B  -> preserves: at the end of transaction from A -> A+B, from B -> A+2B 
b) B := A+B; A := A+B  -> doesn't preserve: A -> 2A+B, B -> A+B
c) A := B+1; B := A+1  -> preserves: A -> B+1, B -> B+2

Basic operations:
Input (x):   system reads block containing x into memory
Output (x):  system writes block containing x to disk
Read (x,t):  read x into transaction's local variable t (input(x) if necessary)
Write (x,t): write value of t into x in memory (input(x) if necessary)
t:= ...      give new value to local variable t

Exercise 17.1.2: 
For each of the transactions of Exercise 17.1.1, add the
read- and write-actions to the computation and show the effect of the steps on
main memory and disk. Assume that initially A = 5 and B = 10.

              t   s   M-A   M-B   D-A   D-B
---------------------------------------------
READ(A,t)     5        5           5     10
READ(B,s)     5   10   5     10    5     10
t:=t+s       15   10   5     10    5     10
WRITE(A,t)   15   10  15     10    5     10
s:=t+s       15   25  15     10    5     10
WRITE(B,s)   15   25  15     25    5     10
OUTPUT(A)    15   25  15     25   15     10
OUTPUT(B)    15   25  15     25   15     25


Exercise 17.2.1: 
Show the undo-log records for each of the transactions (call each T) 
of Exercise 17.1.1, assuming that initially A = 5 and B = 10.
Log records: <START, T>, <T,A,5>, <T,B,10>, <T,COMMIT>

Rules of UNDO log:
1. write log entries to disk (Write Ahead Log) [<T, ...> ... + FLUSH LOG]
2. write modified data elements to disk [output(X)] (-> problem: too frequent output)
3. write COMMIT log entry to log file on disk [<T, commit> + FLUSH LOG]

Exercise 17.2.4: 
The following is a sequence of undo-log records written by two transactions T and U: 
<T, A, 10> 
<start U> 
<U, B, 20> 
<T, C, 30> 
<U, D, 40>
<T, A, 11>
<U, B, 21>  
<COMMIT U>
<T, E, 50> 
<COMMIT T>
Describe the action of the recovery manager, including changes to both disk and the log,
if there is a crash and the last log record to appear on disk is:
(a) <START U>   -> WRITE(A,10), OUTPUT(A), <ABORT,T>, <ABORT,U>, FLUSH LOG
(b) <C0MMIT U>  -> WRITW(A,11), OUTPUT(A), WRITE(C,30), OUTPUT(C), WRITE(A,10) OUTPUT(A), <ABORT,T>, FLUSH LOG
(c) <T, E, 50>  -> WRITE(E,50), OUTPUT(E), WRITE(A,11), OUTPUT(A), WRITE(C,30), OUTPUT(C), 
                   WRITE(A,10) OUTPUT(A), <ABORT,T>, FLUSH LOG
(d) <C0MMIT T>  -> Do nothing


Checkpoint in UNDO LOG (simple) 
  Decide the Checkpoint
  Wait till all active transaction finish (no new transactions)
  <CKPT> + FLUSH LOG

Checkpoint in UNDO LOG (non-quiescent) 
  <START CKPT(T1, T2, ... Tk)> + FLUSH LOG
  Wait till all active transaction finish (new transactions can work)
  <END CKPT> + FLUSH LOG

For Recovery:
Last <END CKPT> - <START CKPT> pair (-> we don't need the log before <START CKPT>)
If we find <START CKPT(Ti)> -> first <START, Ti> 

Exercise 17.3.1: 
Show the redo-log records for each of the transactions (call each T) 
of Exercise 17.1.1, assuming that initially A = 5 and B = 10.
-> Log records: <START, T>, <T,A,15>, <T,B,25>, <T,COMMIT>, <T,END>

Rules of REDO log:
1. write log entries to disk (Write Ahead Log) [<T, ...> ... + FLUSH LOG]
2. write COMMIT log entry to log file on disk [<T, commit> + FLUSH LOG]
3. write modified data elements to disk [output(X)] (-> problem: too late output)
4. write END log entry to log file on disk [<T, end> + FLUSH LOG]

Exercise 17.3.3: 
Repeat Exercise 17.2.4 for redo logging.
<T, A, 10> 
<start U> 
<U, B, 20> 
<T, C, 30> 
<U, D, 40>
<T, A, 11>
<U, B, 21>  
<COMMIT U>
<T, E, 50> 
<COMMIT T>
Describe the action of the recovery manager, including changes to both disk and the log,
if there is a crash and the last log record to appear on disk is:
(a) <START U>   -> Do nothing
(b) <C0MMIT U>  -> WRITE(B,20), OUTPUT(B), WRITE(D,40) OUTPUT(D), WRITE(B,21) OUTPUT(D), <END,U>, FLUSH LOG
(c) <T, E, 50>  -> same as in b)
(d) <C0MMIT T>  -> WRITE(B,20), OUTPUT(B), WRITE(D,40) OUTPUT(D), WRITE(B,21) OUTPUT(D), <END,U>, FLUSH LOG,
                   WRITE(A,10), OUTPUT(A), WRITE(C,30) OUTPUT(C), WRITE(A,11), OUTPUT(A), 
                   WRITE(E,50), OUTPUT(E), <END,T>, FLUSH LOG

Checkpoint (in REDO LOG)
  <START CKPT(T1, T2, ... Tk)> + FLUSH LOG
  Write dirty buffers of transactions committed before START CKPT to disk
  <END CKPT> + FLUSH LOG

For Recovery enough: last <END CKPT> - <START CKPT(Ti)> pair 
First <START Ti> 

Exercise 17.4.1: 
Show the undo/redo-log records for each of the transactions (call each T) 
of Exercise 17.1.1, assuming that initially A = 5 and B = 10.
-> Log records: <START, T>, <T,A,5,15>, <T,B,10,25>, <T,COMMIT>, <T,END>

Rules of UNDO/REDO log:
1. write log entries to disk (Write Ahead Log)
   <T, COMMIT> can be written before OUTPUT or after OUTPUT

Exercise 17.4.3: 
The following is a sequence of undo/redo-log records written by two transactions T and U: 
<START T>; 
<T, A, 10, 11>; 
<START U>;
<U, B, 20, 21 >; 
<T, C, 30, 31>; 
<U, D, 40, 41>; 
<C0MMIT U>; 
<T, E, 50, 51>;
<C0MMIT T>.
Describe the action of the recovery manager, including changes to both disk and the log, 
if there is a crash and the last log record to appear on disk is:
(a) <START U>       -> undo steps for T and U
(b) <C0MMIT U>      -> undo steps for T and redo steps for U
(c) <T, E, 50, 51>  -> undo steps for T and redo steps for U
(d) <C0MMIT T >     -> redo steps for T and U

Checkpoint (in UNDO/REDO LOG)
  <START CKPT(T1, T2, ... Tk)> + FLUSH LOG
  Write all dirty buffers to disk
  <END CKPT> + FLUSH LOG

For Recovery according to UNDO or REDO rules
