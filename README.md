# Computer Graphics

This is repository for practice classes of 2018 computer graphics course in ELTE. I create a branch for each practice and commit changes after each major task is done. This way you can easily review the steps for accomplishing a task.
For first two classes I had to leave early since it's overlapping with another class, but for following weeks I'll probably stay longer
